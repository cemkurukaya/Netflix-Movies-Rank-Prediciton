I developed this project with anaconda spyder. My advice to you would be to run it like that.
1.2.1 is considered appropriate as the Xgboost version.

For installation in Anaconda
These codes need to be installed in the terminal.

> "conda install -c conda-forge xgboost"

> "pip install xgboost==1.2.1"

or you can install it from the requirements.txt file.

> "pip install -r requirements.txt"
